# How to Solve Custom GPT Bug: Making Hyperlinks Clickable

In the ever-evolving world of AI and custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) applications, a common hurdle that developers and content creators face is making hyperlinks clickable in the generated text. This blog post explores an effective solution to this issue, enhancing user interaction and ensuring a smoother experience.

## The Challenge with Hyperlinks in GPT-Generated Content

When GPTs generate text that includes URLs, these hyperlinks are not always automatically clickable. This can lead to a less engaging user experience, as readers might have to copy and paste URLs into their browsers manually. In the context of web content, user engagement and convenience are paramount, making this a significant issue to address.

### Why Clickable Hyperlinks Matter

- **User Experience:** Clickable links provide a seamless browsing experience.
- **SEO Optimization:** Properly formatted links can boost SEO rankings.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** Interactive elements like clickable hyperlinks keep the audience engaged and on-page longer.

## Implementing Clickable Hyperlinks with Custom GPTs

Recently, I developed a custom GPT solution that tackles this issue. Here's a brief overview of the implementation process:

### Implementation Steps

1. **Simple Prompt-Based Recommendations:**
   For limited recommendations, a straightforward prompt can be effective. For instance, recommending books like "Antifragile" and "10x is easier than 2x" with their clickable links.

2. **Utilizing a CSV File for Extensive Recommendations:**
   For handling a more extensive set of recommendations, maintaining a CSV file with book names, descriptions, and URLs is practical. This file is uploaded as Knowledge to the GPTs, and the system retrieves recommended books and links accordingly.

3. **Integration with External Databases:**
   To dynamically fetch relevant books and links, GPT actions can access external databases. This allows for up-to-date and varied recommendations.
