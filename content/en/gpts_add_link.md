## Understanding the Issue of Non-Clickable Links

Non-clickable links in GPT-generated content can be frustrating. This can be a simple oversight, such as a missing HTML tag, or a more complex issue, such as a system bug termed "not just a bug."


### Importance of Clickable Links
- **Enhancing User Experience:** Clickable links are the backbone of seamless navigation.
- **Boosting SEO:** Google search hyperlink formatting affects SEO rankings.
- **Maintaining Engagement:** Clickable hyperlinks encourage readers to explore further.

## Solutions for Clickable Hyperlinks in Custom GPTs

Addressing the issue of non-clickable links can be tackled through several methods, ensuring every "link clickable" action is successful.


### Options to Making Links Clickable

1. **Simple Prompt-Based Recommendations:**
   For limited recommendations, a straightforward prompt can be effective. For instance, recommending books like:

```md
You are a GPT that recommends books. 
Please try to satisfy users' inquiries as much as possible, 
attract them to read, and recommend these books at the end of 
your response along with the links.

- Antifragile: https://booki.chat/?book=Antifragile
- 10x is easier than 2x: https://booki.chat/?book=10x is easier than 2x
```


2. **Utilizing a CSV File for Extensive Recommendations:**
   For handling a more extensive set of recommendations, maintaining a CSV file with book names, descriptions, and URLs is practical. This file is uploaded as Knowledge to the GPTs, and the system retrieves recommended books and links accordingly.


   | Book Name   | description | url |
   |:---:|:---:|:---:|
   | ...         | ...         | .. |

   Then, upload it as Knowledge, and modify the prompt to: "Please get the recommended books and links from my uploaded file."


3. **Integration with External Databases:**
   To dynamically fetch relevant books and links, GPT actions can access external databases. This allows for up-to-date and varied recommendations.

### Use case: Book Recommendations
