# Streamlining AI Interactions with Langchain Streaming LLM and OpenAI
Langchain LLM Streaming, leveraging the robustness of OpenAI streams, revolutionizes how we interact with AI by enabling real-time processing of language model tokens through an efficient callback system. This integration not only enhances user experience but also pushes the boundaries of AI's capabilities in data processing and response mechanisms.

## Enhancing AI Communication with Langchain Streaming and Langchain Callbacks
The heart of Langchain's streaming capabilities lies in its constructor callbacks, offering seamless integration with OpenAI's API. By utilizing these callback systems, developers can craft more responsive and dynamic applications that leverage the power of streaming text and the OpenAI API.



### Integrating Callbacks for Real-time Processing

Langchain's callback system transforms how we interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI. By using constructor callbacks and request callbacks, Langchain allows for immediate reactions to the streaming text, improving the overall efficiency of the OpenAI API interactions.


### Utilizing OpenAI's API for Enhanced Responsiveness
The integration of OpenAI's API in Langchain offers a unique opportunity to handle complex prompt prompts and manage OpenAI temperature settings. This capability ensures that the API key is used effectively to send messages and receive prompt responses, demonstrating the power of the calls made on that object with the model attached.


## Exploring Langchain Callbacks and Streaming LLM
Langchain callbacks play a pivotal role in managing the streaming LLM process. By effectively handling the stream of data from OpenAI's LLM, these callbacks ensure that every piece of text is processed in real-time, enhancing the responsiveness of applications.

### Implementing StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler for Synchronous Streaming

The `StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler`, a vital part of the Langchain callbacks system, ensures synchronous processing of LLM outputs. This handler specializes in dealing with real-time scenarios where quick responses are crucial. It utilizes the `on_llm_new_token` method to immediately react to the streaming text, showcasing the efficiency and responsiveness of Langchain streaming.


```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import (
    HumanMessage,
)
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler


chat = ChatOpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)
resp = chat([HumanMessage(content="Write me a song about sparkling water.")])
```

This handler uses the `on_llm_new_token` method to print tokens as they are generated, exemplifying the efficiency of StreamLLM.

```python
class StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
	...
	
	def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
		"""Run on new LLM token. Only available when streaming is enabled."""
		sys.stdout.write(token)
		sys.stdout.flush()

```




### Asynchronous Efficiency with AsyncIteratorCallbackHandler
In contrast, the `AsyncIteratorCallbackHandler` is designed for tasks where non-blocking operations are essential. This part of the Langchain callbacks architecture excels in handling streaming LLM in an asynchronous manner, making it an ideal choice for scalable solutions.


```python
import asyncio

from langchain.callbacks import AsyncIteratorCallbackHandler
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage
import os
import openai
from typing import AsyncIterable, Awaitable

# Async chat function for interacting with the ChatOpenAI model
async def async_chat(message) -> AsyncIterable[str]:
    # Create an asynchronous callback handler
    callback = AsyncIteratorCallbackHandler()
    # Create a ChatOpenAI instance with streaming mode enabled, using the callback handler and a temperature parameter
    chat = ChatOpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[callback], temperature=0)

    # Define an asynchronous function to wrap another asynchronous function and signal completion or exceptions using an event
    async def wrap_done(fn: Awaitable, event: asyncio.Event):
        try:
            await fn  # Wait for the provided asynchronous function to complete
        except Exception as e:
            # TODO: Handle exceptions - here, we simply print the exception information
            print(f"Caught exception: {e}")
        finally:
            event.set()  # Set the event to indicate completion

    # Create a task to perform message generation with ChatOpenAI and monitor the completion event of the callback handler
    task = asyncio.create_task(wrap_done(chat.agenerate(messages=[[HumanMessage(content=message)]], callback.done))

    # Iterate asynchronously to obtain tokens from the callback handler
    async for token in callback.aiter():
        yield f"{token}"  # Convert tokens to strings and yield them

    await task  # Wait for the task to complete

# Async function to print tokens generated by ChatOpenAI
async def async_print():
    message = "Write me a song about sparkling water."
    async for token in async_chat(message):
        print(token, end='')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(async_print())  # Run the async_print function as the entry point
```

This code demonstrates the asynchronous processing of Langchain LLM tokens, making it ideal for scalable applications that utilize OpenAI stream response.



## Conclusion: The Future of AI with Langchain and OpenAI
Langchain, when combined with OpenAI streams, represents a significant step forward in the world of real-time LLM token processing. Whether it's through synchronous or asynchronous methods, the integration of Langchain callbacks and streaming LLM with OpenAI's API enhances the capabilities and efficiency of AI applications.
