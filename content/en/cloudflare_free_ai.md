# How to build a Zero-Cost AI Application: A Step-by-Step Guide Using Cloudflare

Discover how to leverage Cloudflare's free plan for constructing AI applications at no cost. This guide details using JavaScript and Cloudflareâ€™s services such as Cloudflare AI, Worker, and Page to build an efficient AI application.


## Getting Started with Cloudflare for AI Applications

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Cloudflare Account
Begin by [registering and activating a Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up). Once set up, access your domain dashboard to obtain crucial authentication details like `Account ID`, and an [API Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

### Step 2: Exploring Cloudflare AI

Cloudflare AI offers a range of free models suitable for various AI applications:

- @cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5
- @cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5
- @cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5
- @cf/huggingface/distilbert-sst-2-int8
- @cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-fp16
- @cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8
- @cf/meta/m2m100-1.2b
- @cf/microsoft/resnet-50
- @cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1
- @cf/openai/whisper
- @cf/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0

Test these models using the command line with your `ACCOUNT_ID` and `API_TOKEN`:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a friendly assistant that helps write stories"},{"role":"user","content":"Write a short story about a llama that goes on a journey to find an orange cloud"}]}'
```

###  Overcoming CORS Challenges

When using Cloudflare Page, you might face Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues. A Cloudflare Worker script can handle CORS and forward AI model requests efficiently:

```js
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

// The main request handling function
async function handleRequest(request) {

  // Handle CORS preflight requests
  if (request.method === "OPTIONS") {
    return handleCors();
  }

  return handleChatGPTRequest(request);
}

// Function to handle CORS preflight requests
function handleCors() {
  return new Response(null, {
    headers: {
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS"
    }
  });
}

async function handleChatGPTRequest(request) {
  const url = `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8`;

  const headers = {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${BEARER_TOKEN}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  };

  const newRequest = new Request(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: request.body
  });

  const response = await fetch(newRequest);
  const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response);
  newResponse.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");

  return newResponse;
}
```

1. Upload this script to your Cloudflare Worker.
2. Configure `ACCOUNT_ID` and `BEARER_TOKEN` in the Worker settings (Settings -> Variables).
3. Test your Worker: click Quick Edit, and directly use Cloudflare's built-in functionality for testing.

### Designing the Frontend with Cloudflare Page

Cloudflare Page acts as the frontend interface. Design your AI application's user interface tailored to your aesthetic preferences. Cloudflare Page can be linked with a GitHub project for seamless updates. For detailed instructions, check out the [Getting Started Guide for Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/guide/).


## Conclusion: Launching Your Free AI Application

Following the above steps, you can build a free AI application, such as the one I built, [FreeChat](https://freechat.mggg.cloud/), which includes image and text generation capabilities and dialogue models.
